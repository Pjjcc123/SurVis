abstract = {Emergence of communication technologies made the automotive industries across the globe to embrace Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) by considerable investments to ensure accident-free travel, reduction of pollution, fuel conservation. ADAS achieves its goals by integrating complex subsystems such as obstacle avoidance, overtaking advice, lane changing assistance, planning shortest routes, parking assistance, automatic gear shifting, etc., using the emerging technologies. This article emphasizes the road safety aspect of the ADAS by exploring Crash Avoidance and Overtaking Advice (CAOA) subsystems. Existing studies have a noticeable lack of connectivity between various aspects of CAOA subsystems. This review deeply explores and connects CAOA subsystems like road geometries, road debris, obstacle avoidance algorithms powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), overtaking advice systems, perception challenges of human drivers in various light and weather conditions, driver inattention and misjudgments, vehicle blind-spots, vehicle parameter analysis, performance of vision sensors, in-vehicle computers, driver–vehicle interactions, Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) technologies. This article emphasizes the three primary performance metrics of the ADAS, namely accuracy, response time and robustness. Finally, this article discusses a typical functional architecture and gaps identified in existing studies. This article is structured to assist like-minded researchers, who work on CAOA systems for road safety.}

abstract = {Trajectory prediction and behavioral decision-making are two important tasks for autonomous vehicles that require a good understanding of the environmental context. Notably, behavioral decisions are better made by referring to the outputs of trajectory predictions. However, most current solutions perform these tasks separately. Therefore, this paper proposes a new joint holistic transformer network that combines multiple cues to predict trajectories and make behavioral decisions simultaneously. To better explore the intrinsic relationships among cues, the network uses existing knowledge and adopts three kinds of attention mechanisms: the sparse multi-head type for reducing noise impact, feature selection sparse type for optimally using partial prior knowledge, and multi-head with sigmoid activation type for optimally using posteriori knowledge. Compared with other trajectory prediction models, the proposed model has a better comprehensive performance and good interpretability. Perceptual noise robustness experiments demonstrate that the proposed model has good noise robustness. Thus, simultaneous trajectory prediction and behavioral decision-making combining multiple cues are accomplished, which reduces computational costs and enhances semantic relationships between scenes and agents.}

abstract = {The significant contribution of human errors, accounting for approximately 94% (with a margin of ±2.2%), to road crashes leading to casualties, vehicle damages, and safety concerns necessitates the exploration of alternative approaches. Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have emerged as a promising solution by replacing human drivers with advanced computer-aided decision-making systems. However, for AVs to effectively navigate the road, they must possess the capability to predict the future behaviour of nearby traffic participants, similar to the predictive driving abilities of human drivers. Building upon existing literature is crucial to advance the field and develop a comprehensive understanding of trajectory prediction methods in the context of automated driving. To address this need, we have undertaken a comprehensive review that focuses on trajectory prediction methods for AVs, with a particular emphasis on machine learning techniques including deep learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches. We have extensively examined over two hundred studies related to trajectory prediction in the context of AVs. The paper begins with an introduction to the general problem of predicting vehicle trajectories and provides an overview of the key concepts and terminology used throughout. After providing a brief overview of conventional methods, this review conducts a comprehensive evaluation of several deep learning-based techniques. Each method is summarized briefly, accompanied by a detailed analysis of its strengths and weaknesses. The discussion further extends to reinforcement learning-based methods. This article also examines the various datasets and evaluation metrics that are commonly used in trajectory prediction tasks. Encouraging an unbiased and objective discussion, we compare two major learning processes, considering specific functional features. By identifying challenges in the existing literature and outlining potential research directions, this review significantly contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the domain of AV trajectory prediction. Its primary objective is to streamline current research efforts and offer a futuristic perspective, ultimately benefiting future developments in the field.}

ABSTRACT = {Predicting the trajectories of surrounding vehicles is important to avoid or mitigate collision with traffic participants. However, due to limited past information and the uncertainty in future driving maneuvers, trajectory prediction is a challenging task. Recently, trajectory prediction models using machine learning algorithms have been addressed solve to this problem. In this paper, we present a trajectory prediction method based on the random forest (RF) algorithm and the long short term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder architecture. An occupancy grid map is first defined for the region surrounding the target vehicle, and then the row and the column that will be occupied by the target vehicle at future time steps are determined using the RF algorithm and the LSTM encoder-decoder architecture, respectively. For the collection of training data, the test vehicle was equipped with a camera and LIDAR sensors along with vehicular wireless communication devices, and the experiments were conducted under various driving scenarios. The vehicle test results demonstrate that the proposed method provides more robust trajectory prediction compared with existing trajectory prediction methods.},

abstract = {A primary task in autonomous driving is to design a control algorithm that presents an effective and yet human-compatible behavior. To this aim, present paper considers the problem of autonomous overtaking under both state and environment constraints with dynamic surrounding vehicles. The solution is formulated based on quadratic programming optimization and is solved in receding horizon fashion. The proposed method evaluates the traffic condition online and executes a safe trajectory of an overtaking maneuver with on-coming traffic. To better incorporate traffic participants’ behaviors, a dynamic predictive model-based reachability analysis of the surrounding vehicles is utilized in the design. Reachable sets aim to ensure the drivability of the planned motions, as well as producing drivable collision-free trajectories. To this end, forward reachable sets are employed by predicting traffic vehicles’ future actual and worst-case behaviors in the design, in which the autonomous vehicle determines its trajectory accordingly. A simulation scenario is tested via MATLAB/Simulink for autonomous overtaking and the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown, demonstrating the potential utility of the present approach for implementation as an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) in next-generation vehicles.}
